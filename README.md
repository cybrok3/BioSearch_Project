ðŸ”Ž Introducing BioSearch: A Search Engine for Doctors

Last year I worked on BioSearch, a solo project for one of my computer science classes CS-463, in which I had to build a search engine to help doctors efficiently retrieve clinical cases from their own collections.

Hereâ€™s how it works: 
âœ… A doctor provides an XML collection of clinical cases. 
âœ… The engine processes the data, creating an index, a vocabulary, and other necessary components. 
âœ… Once indexed, the doctor can perform keyword searches, and the engine retrieves the most relevant documents using cosine similarity scoring.

This project was a great opportunity to dive into indexing, information retrieval, and query processing, building a functional search engine from the ground up.

Of course it can be used with any xml documents collection, but the theme here is for clinical cases.
